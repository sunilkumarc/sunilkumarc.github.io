	<h2>How to win every single time someone challenges you on QuizUp</h2>
	<p>Hello, World! In this post I am going to explain about a bug of QuizUp application which lets you win every time someone challenges you on QuizUp in any category. This is more of a method to make sure you win than a bug. If you still haven’t tried the game, <a href="https://www.quizup.com/" id="quizup-download-link">download </a>it and check it out. It’s cool.
