		<p>Hello, and welcome to my website!</p>
<p>
I am a Computer Science graduate from PES Institute Of Technology, Bangalore. I love building stuff. I started hacking 3 years ago. Since then I have had the oppurtunity to learn some great technologies, languages and platforms. I currently work as a Developer Associate at SAP Labs India Pvt Ltd. I grew up in a small town called Sorab which is in Karnataka, India. I have been living in Bangalore since I came here for Engineering. I am a die hard fan of Sachin Tendulkar. I love watching Movies, TV Shows, Cricket, Football, Tennis, F1 and many other sports. I also enjoy listening to Music.</p>
